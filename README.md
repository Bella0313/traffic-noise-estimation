# traffic-noise-estimation
we propose a computational framework to estimate traffic noise using street view images and deep learning approaches based on real-world measurement. The proposed model can achieve end-to-end output from street view images to road traffic noise (sound perception in decibel levels)  
## requirement
The python version used was **Python 3.9.7**, The requirements to execute the code is in the file **requirements.txt**
